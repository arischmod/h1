for Initializing the application I used simple Composer framework commands. Specifically the "laravel new h1" command line tool which is a new feature of Laravel 5.5
Otherwise equally easy we could use the:
"composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel h1" command which also works for previous releases and is actually what "laravel" command sits on top



sudo chmod -R 775 app/storage
sudo chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache

php artisan serve


php artisan make:model Blog

BlogController.php

Routs /api
